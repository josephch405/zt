I wake up after meeting up with O-tone folks on Saturday.

That was a separate trip that probably deserves its own recall. Putting that on the queue next.

In any case I was somewhat tired since the show about comfort women was emotionally intense. I wake up with Rongfei and we're panick packing because Anand wants us to Uber to Adi's place down south. Which makes logical and customary sense but I was thinking "why not just have Adi pick us up he has a car".

We take an Uber to Anand's and pick him up, then try to find our way to Adi's. Apparently there was an Uber office around Sunnyvale (turns out this was actually downtown sunnyvale and I was just bad at recognizing it). Adi pulls up in his red car, we load as much stuff as we can (and struggle to do so, foreshadowing our packing problems on the last day) and we zoom off. Well, after a coffee stop for Adi.

It was probably the most sober conversation I had on the trip, ngl. We talked about getting consulting jobs and Rongfei looking for some seat that Anand could just hand out to him (judging on tree hacks or the like). We talked about how one of the cities on our route was known for gay orgies or something. Eventually we stopped for lunch, and Anand was somewhat stressed about making a call because our food was late. I remember that the server at the Poke station was kinda cute, short girl with darkish skin. Hmm. Hopefully this doesn't become a simp journal.

We continue down south and I nap for a good portion of this trip. We stop at this inn of sorts (looked closed, Anand thought it looked like a gas station) which had a supercharger. That was a common theme throughout the trip, a lot of supercharger trips.

We were about to head down to
