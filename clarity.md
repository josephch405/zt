No this is not about the car
Just writing literally one line a day is enough here I'm not looking for volume I'm looking for persistent movement
Stop and you are dead
This is more about motivation instead of clarity
I want to figure out how to achieve a clearer vision over my work and how to prioritize different work streams. I want this clarity because I have been spending time these past few weeks in ways I believe to be suboptimal. I believe this is true because I don't feel like I'm moving the needle for the team. Cautionary tales of folks leaving Waymo aside, I genuinely want to feel like I'm making an impact. That's why I jumped onto the data pipeline rework. After talking to Lexiang I gained a different perspective about what constitutes impact. For my team in particular impact is defined as changes that move the one metric we care about.
I take some partiular issue with that definition as I believe understanding the model is just as important. We need to understand the model in order to figure out where our blind spots are.
