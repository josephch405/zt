A story about a boy who falls in love with aromantic people
Stem: father is aro, mother is overromantic



He looked up.

It was 7.13 am, and he was typing in a Lyft ride to the airport. He had wanted to be frugal and take the subway, but did some quick maths and decided the 40 dollars he'd save wasn't worth the stress.

Typing because he didn't know what else to do. He could read, he supposed. He spent a good amount of his second week in NYC re-reading Brave New World, along the process rediscovering a lot of nuances he'd missed from high school almost half a decade ago. Maybe he wanted to feel young again, to get the sort of fresh out of school feeling back since it's been a month after his job started and the monotony was somewhat setitng in.



This could be a hella cool song title ... 

I'm a romantic but she's aromantic
