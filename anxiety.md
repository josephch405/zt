I get very fidgety sometimes.

I'm continuing a thread from therapy. Giti (therapist) suggested that I look into light meds for obsessive thoughts and general anxiety, so I'm deciding to hone in on meditative practices.

I'll use this page as an obsessive thoughts log as well. My memory is not very reliable except for highly emotional experiences, which I suspect is quite normal.

Deep dark thoughts. Here we go.

I heard that Andrea is headed up to SF to meet a female high school friend. She asks Atharva (lives in SF) if he's free on Saturday to hang. First thought: so she does kind of have female friends? Maybe I judged too harshly. How silly of me to be judgey about this. I don't even know if I'd pass my own litmus test on friends. And yes I'm a bit sad she didn't invite me but I don't actually care - or at least my rational thoughts don't. 

I also notice her smiling and typing every once in a while. She's definitely chatting with Oscar or whoever else. I shouldn't care but I kinda do. This sucks. Why did I decide to spend a decent morning start on this bullshit.

Being a better and more intimate friend regularizes my behavior, in contrast to things I'd do for someone I'm romantically interested in. Example: I thought bringing food for Andrea was a simp move. But I'm realizing that I'd also do it for my friends too (Cyn today) - maybe I'm just too much of a nice person and I confuse myself with my own behavior. Hmm.

Another gem - seeing David follow Jingwen on github. Out of all things this is so fucking rediculous to get triggered by. Yes you are being ghosted. She probably just wants space. I really do seem to have jealousy issues... back even during Cornell I'd get jealous easily when Laura hung out with Ryan. I honestly don't know why I'm like this...

I get jealous over achievements in general as well. To some extent I'm a bit jealous of Trev and Justin.

I don't like my obsessive thoughts. A particular set of them:
"I wanna fcking die"
"Why am I so bad at ..."
"I wanna kill myself"
"Fuck this shit"
"I hate it"
**"I hate myself"**
"Piece of shit"
Thing is, the suicidal ones aren't exactly that powerful in that I don't actually start ideating, but it's definitely not a good sign...

I feel like a headless chicken sometimes. Sometimes socially, sometimes at work. I kinda just do whatever.

The phrase "I hate myself" in particular is constant. I don't know why. The CBT way of tackling this is to break down why I hate myself - that I'm just saying it for the sake of saying it. Typically there's some associted reason, though.

Just now, I said that in relation to how I feel like I don't have any close friends. That is factually untrue, or at least given a fairly liberal interpretation of the term "close". On the other hand, I want to become closer to some of my friends. And because this tends to be a weird set (female friends, other friends I simp for), I feel disgusted by myself. That I am not making friends for the right reasons.

And then this extends to a weird back and forth when I also apply this mindset to other people. People who get close for me, and what their reasons are for doing so. The dark voice is telling me that I don't deserve anyone caring, and the voice somehow convinces me that it's right. Factually, no. That's untrue. But it becomes a very tiresome argument. I can bring up family - they want to talk to me. But do I? I mean, yes, but I feel guilty about the one-sided intensity. Then I can bring up my other friends, but at the moment my headspace is dominated by people who I want to talk to more but can't (Andrea for self imposed reasons mostly, JW ghosting me basically, and other friends mostly where I don't know what to talk about). Maybe I can find folks from very different distributions - folks who are not afraid to be opinionated. Or rather... folks who can decide what living is about? Right now I don't really know what I'm living for. Just sort of aimlessly floating into and out of work, pretending that I'm gonna try new things but ultimately just staying at home and doing the same shit over and over again. 

This is just turning into a large rant diary.

I feel an immense pressure telling me something is always wrong. That I am not perfect, or I am not where I want to be. Which I suppose is the common denominator underpinning all of humanity's will to live. I wonder if this is distinct from the will to power, the nobler version of the human will to rise up to the occasion instead of staring slack jawed at the intractability of it all.

Maybe I should dedicate a whole page to heartbreak. It ties into anxiety but also is kind of its own topic at this point.

This thread might as well go into a bit of depression. I'm feeling socially depressed somehow. Despite going to events and meeting people, I don't feel like I'm meeting people I truly connect with. The few times I thought I did, I was basically just being horny. I don't fucking know anymore. Laundry's probably almost done.
