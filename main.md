Not sure what to put here yet. Overarching goals:

- [[music]]
- [[urban planning]]/[[transit]]
- [[ml]]/[[math]]/[[graphics]]

The notebook method of planning out each day is rather... cumbersome? I'm still mostly productive. I'm not burning massive amounts of time on games unless it's every once in a while... it feels oddly like wanking off. Except in this sense it's wanking off to boredom? No, more like doing something until it's no longer interesting. [[ennui]] is the right word. Maybe I'll have an entry on that.
