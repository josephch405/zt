Core basics:
- Hydrate until you can't
- Lower abdomen - mid - chest breaths x 10. Magic fix!
- Relaxed jaw
- Stretch lips out/smile

[[pelvis tilt]] - causes lower abdomen tension! Pinch butts and straighten

try tilting head up \[+1\]
back tongue relaxing - actually feels like filling up

Chest and shoulder/back posture - slide shoulder blades back or do relax exercises (shrugging)

Wing out arms to make space around body

- Jaw outwards/open
- Stomach relax, then strength/clench
- head back, shoulders and back straight; back breathing?
- Good breathing should feel like taking a dump

High notes
- High note slight tension but least possible?
- Tall mouth

Style
- Flowing melodic phrasing
- Good melody needs to be accompanied with emotional intonation - or at least, mindful intonation

Imagine a ball in front floating up and down for intonations
Throat can be a bit tight?
Enunciation? Use back of throat as a stopper for note start
Bring pallate up until you get resonance

I really need lessons or pointers or just ingest a large volume of videos on this
