An interesting thought today: I want to live in first person and not the third person.

I habitually assess events and actions from a bystander perspective. 

Living in the first person means not overthinking things. It's being in the here and now, focused purely on the critical path of consciousness and attention. 


This relates to brain fog to some extent? Not sure why I archived that entry.

I can tell when my brain is in fog. It most definitely is right now. 

The feeling that I'm gasping for more air, and the fight for flight responses kick in.
