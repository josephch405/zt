Interesting intro chats with Diwakar and Yusef - I want to chat with more people across Waymo
Coffee chat with Lan - really enjoyed it! A pretty deep convo which I appreciate. I feel just a tad bit awkward - and it can't really be because it's my first time meeting up with intention of dating, done that plenty of times at this point. I am interested in meeting her more from now on, but I can't get a good read on her end. Might as well try yeah?

Went to kopitiam - finally - with Rongfei, then Cyn and Tom came by too. Div swung by a bit later. We checked out the b8ta store and some very expensive boarded up clothes place with guards. Apparently they were hit by a few dozen gang members before.
Went to hotpot with Taiwanese Stanford folks - it was oddly wholesome.

Went to the Redwoods with Andrea and Ray. Sometimes I really did feel like I was third wheeling. I dunno man. I honestly don't know what Ray's own take on this is. They hang out almost every day pretty much. I'll detail in this day eventually.
