Reading the book on CBT - don't remember the title.

The introduction of the book is cleverly written in a moderately self critical way such that both optimistic and pessimistic first time readers can self insert into the scenarios. In particular I like how the author couches by going through the bad assumptions first, ie. "I understand that you might not believe me, BUT..." and continues to impound what he wants his readers to believe. I don't believe this is done with malicious intent so good for him for writing well.

In any case I'm going to be chewing through this book for a while.

The core tenet of CBT is that you respond emotionally to external events, and this inner process can be tuned towards good mental health. In general this means catching and acknowledging subconcious or reactionary thoughts that are unrealistic or more "doom and gloom" than grounded in reality.
