Core basics:
- Hydrate until you can't
- Lower abdomen - mid - chest breaths x 10. Magic fix!

Jaw relaxing is important

Enunciation is key - next blocker

[[pelvis tilt]] - causes lower abdomen tension! Pinch butts and straighten

try tilting head up \[+1\]
back tongue relaxing - actually feels like filling up

Jaw lock - make sure you are pivoting your jaw and not "dropping" it

Smile!

Chest and shoulder/back posture - slide shoulder blades back or do relax exercises (shrugging)

Wing out arms to make space around body

- Jaw outwards/open
- Stomach relax, then strength/clench
- head back, shoulders and back straight; back breathing?
- Good breathing should feel like taking a dump
- Trumpet airflow

High notes
- High note slight tension but least possible?
- Tall mouth

Style
- Flowing melodic phrasing
- Good melody needs to be accompanied with emotional intonation - or at least, mindful intonation
