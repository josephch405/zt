Motivation is obviously something that comes and goes, and to some extent success = how well you can capture and convert that momentum into something concrete

Some things to define: concrete progress, motivation, consciouseness/conscientiousness (I do not know the difference here hmm)

I want to figure out specific goals and outcomes. I've been thinking about abstract directions and fields but not enough about results. Therefore I don't feel that I am achieving anything important.

Setting OKRs for myself might be a good idea at this rate... but the tricky part is to be adaptable. I did not follow my old OKRs because I was too lazy to maintain and update them. Once they become irrelevant I lose motivation to stick to them. OKRs need to be aligned properly.

I did basically nothing today. Well, I woke up, wanted to take a bath, so I went out and bought some things from the Ace Hardware store. And that's the most I've moved.
I played and watched some league. Watched one video from the diplomat polyglot person (Kaufman?). Then played a few games of league. Still bad. Am identifying particular things I can improve at, in particular getting a better sense of trades. I also panick for no reason.
