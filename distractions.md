I spend a lot of time on things that feel good in the moment but don't build towards anything meaningful. A shortlist:
- Checking my finances daily
- Checking long running jobs at work
- Reading random things
- Tiktok
- Youtube

I want to mentally train myself to have better defaults.
Defaults shape your life. There is always a mental cost to making a decision. This cost is significantly lower when picking the default option.
The default is embedded in the subconsious. Dedicated intent can change that.
Let's start a mental practice of being focused and always clearly assessing what I'm doing.
Right now I am laying out a framework of thinking and sticking to it.
It is uncomfortable to do new things. Which makes it all the more important to do it anyway. It is physical pain, but I want to accept it as a good kind of pain.
