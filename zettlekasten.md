Possibly try to write a VS Code plugin? This is a nice editing environment.

Could try to leverage Markdown editing tools.

- New notes have titles automatically
- Continue lists in Markdown
- Timestamp things somehow (leverage git maybe?)

Update (12/2020): Sticking to Obsidian more now.

I wonder if there's a way to do ZT with videos? Make little persona tiktoks for yourself. They would contain snippets of ideas. Not sure how linking ideas would work though.
