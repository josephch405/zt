Starting a new thread to keep the anxiety doc tractable.

Chatting with Jerry was fun yesterday. We talked about our romantic pursuits, me with my failures and Jerry with his Quest for Tall Women.

In any case Jingwen has yet to reply (and I suppose I should actually figure out whether I should just ask to meet up), and I'm definitely still too affected by Andrea (and Rui by extension). I don't know what to think about this anymore. The notion that I could hold out and distance myself through sheer willpower and be fine with it seems silly. I'm literally still processing the fact that Matthew asked Andrea to invite people to a dinner, she invited Rui, and I wasn't pinged about this at all. See it feels even worse - I don't really get to be annoyed about this because I wouldn't have made it anyways. 

I don't get what Rui's headspace even looks like to be honest. Everyone and their mother knows he's simping for her, and at this point Andrea's either just actually oblivious or is tolerating it somehow. Or yes, she could be reciprocative. In which case good for her. But I don't see why my emotional brain has to come into this at all - stay away, stay away. Good song lyrics there. Stay the fuck away.

I observe waves of emotions. Sometimes they seem drastic. But the cyclic component interests me a lot because I can learn to leverage cycles.

It's impossible to be content all the time. Whether or not an observation in hindsight, feeling "down"

Talking to people definitely helps. To some extent this means talking to new people. The kind of good feeling that comes with a good convo is quite hard to quantify, honestly...
