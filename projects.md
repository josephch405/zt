Ideas that I would want in my life


Instrument/sample market

Anonymous music feedback platform
Live music collab platform

International news - curated, localized properly
Language immersion/learning - making friends internationally
Resources for english speakers to move into taiwan
	Cultural barrier - Taiwanese ppl find all english to be annoying, a bit insular

Unified car stock tracker - with notifs

Some way to replace my defaults. Guided steps for digital detoxing. Ex: moving apps away from home screen, setting app limits, healthy app/book/activity suggestions. Tuning yt/reddit recommendations to healthier threads

A better feed aggregator - hackernews, some subreddits, organized by my own topics
Insight - good meaningful content tends to be long, less bite sized

Music discovery tool, cross platform, cross platform sync
