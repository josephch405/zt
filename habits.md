DEPREC, use [[MASTER workflow and routines]]

Habits need to be automatic, but they also need a trigger sometimes

Current flow:
1. Automatic morning habits. Currently
	1. Probiotic and water
	2. Face wash, teeth brush (in danger)
3. Email clearing
4. Habits on Asana as fit

Honestly, am a bit concerned about how email flows into all this - it's a very disruptive thing to have to tackle emails. It takes away a lot, energy wise, mostly because I'm [[context switching]] a lot.

Update 2021/06/24

As of now my habits:
- Morning hygiene (brush, maybe wash)
- Morning JP (anki 5 min, duolingo)

That's actually about it. Other objectives kinda flow naturally throughout the day. I've decided that the more effort I spend on engineering a system the more I'll just abandon it. Serendipity and consistency is best. A truly good system should mostly be good instincts and good habits, coupled with occasional decision making. It should not overplan.
