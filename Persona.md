I used to be dangerously obsessed with this game. My first Persona experience was playing Persona 4 (not Golden) on my laptop with PS2 emulation since the PC port didn't come out until this year (2020). Despite its age, I got really engrossed in the game. 

To me, most of the value from the series comes from its mystery setting combined with the messages it tries to convey about society and relationships. This was best demonstrated in P4 in my opinion - I never got around to actually playing P3P even though it's just sitting on my PS Vita. P5 is a bit lacking in this department, although the gameplay makes up for it a bit. 

And the music - I definitely had a phase for Persona themed music. It's good shit.

Kind of regret getting the rhythm games though, don't think I'll get around to finishing those at all.
