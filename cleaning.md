As a kid we had to clean.
Cleaning time is a feature of east asian educational institutions, where everyone in the class manages one area of responsibility. For example: blackboard wiping duty (usually includes chalk management and board eraser dusting), outdoor sweeping, room mopping, and the worst - bathroom duty. 

The same concept can be applied to a conscientious work cycle. Maintaining cleanliness and order in your workspace obviously reduces clutter. The main benefit, however, comes from mental clarity. You take stock in what occupies your space, which is generally some physical (or digital) manisfestation of your mind.
