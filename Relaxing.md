Steps to try:
- Mind blocking - imagining a solid block sitting right under my cerebellum, blocking active/conscious access to my body entirely. This is a tricky don't-think-about-the-elephant maneuver, but pays off quite well in terms of destressing
- Taking a bath
- Drink as much water as humanly possible
