Steps to try:
- Mind blocking - imagining a solid block sitting right under my cerebellum, blocking active/conscious access to my body entirely. This is a tricky don't-think-about-the-elephant maneuver, but pays off quite well in terms of destressing
- Taking a bath. Works conditionally. Trying this at the Kingsley apartment is iffy cause the water does not fill up. I suppose I can't really take long baths anymore unless I ask Div for his bathroom. Hmm.
- Drink as much water as humanly possible
