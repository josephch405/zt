dumping some thoughts and topics we discussed

Burning out is not good (90 hour weeks)
Politics is a thing
ML with heuristics on top is an ever moving goalpost
Read a paper a day maybe

Large disconnect between current ML (larger = better) and a human
A human can drive in a month
A human can not do a thing after being told (if the will exists)
The identity function - learn it?
Is higher order thought emergent? Are we missing a piece?

I am very bad at saying anything that could have pertained to this convo
A lot of high up thoughts but nothing is quite coming out from my brain lol
I want to become more thoughtful and precise about knowledge

Start by increasing intake and also output, be precise and concise about my expressions
