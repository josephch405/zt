This was a very stupid time to do the military. But also probably the best.

I've been stressing about the possibility of having to redo the second phase. There's been talk about how the higher ups are talking about this - people who tested for Covid at all (PCR) have to self quarantine, and therefore are not at camp. This means that if you quarantine twice, like I did under the advice of friends and family, you won't meet the requirements.

The way they are talking about it now seems to indicate that we're graduate anyway, but right now it seems like it could go either way. All this comes to a close by the time I get back - there will definitely be folks who have been gone for a long time that will have either graduated or failed to graduate. So we'll see then.

I probably spent way too much time on stressing about this. I am not entirely sure what triggers this [[stress]].

A lot of [[ennui]] when I just sit around. More on that in the page
