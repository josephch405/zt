I am a basic bitch who simps for promo

But sticking on topic here I think it's a good sign that I'm working well with my team. Working on interesting items to actually drive stuff. 

I'm a bit cautious about my mental state regarding how well I actually work, whether this weird need for validation is a weird type of thrill...

So Q2 2022 is quite within the range of possibility and everything.
