Interesting intro chats with Diwakar and Yusef - I want to chat with more people across Waymo
Coffee chat with Lan - really enjoyed it! A pretty deep convo which I appreciate. I feel just a tad bit awkward - and it can't really be because it's my first time meeting up with intention of dating, done that plenty of times at this point. I am interested in meeting her more from now on, but I can't get a good read on her end. Might as well try yeah?
