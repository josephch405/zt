I want to get out there more
That's kinda it for now
I'm thinking about a different topic so I'll focus on that instead

You know what I do miss the feeling of feeling excited about getting a text. I don't know how anyone gets to this point to be honest.

Closeness is a hard thing to gauge. Or it might just be me. I'm not that sure. If you think about it as a spectrum, specifically a spectrum of how well you can understand the spectrum of relationships (so a second order thing) I can probably try to attune myself and become more sensitive.

I still subconciously try to limit myself and how intense I commit to my friends maybe because I realize that there's not necessarily a solid ROI. But also in longer term relationships (family, older friends) I also perceive the stakes to be lower. This could be a problem. I don't seem to value relationships overall as much as I think I should (relationships being general relationships) and this is going slightly out of scope.

And on god do I have shit to say about friendzones. Whoever complains about them really just has to grow the fuck up. People want to make friends. People also want to date. This could be a disjoint set. It's hard enough to make friends and throwing away that for a very slim chance at dating is not a good idea. Well this may be severely biased by my own cherry picked experience as well. Hmm.
