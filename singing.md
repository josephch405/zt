# Singing

Warmup checklist:
- Hydrate until you can't
- Lower abdomen - mid - chest breaths x 10. Magic fix!

Jaw relaxing is important

Enunciation is key - next blocker

[[pelvis tilt]] - causes lower abdomen tension! Pinch butts and straighten

try tilting head up \[+1\]
back tongue relaxing - actually feels like filling up

Jaw lock - make sure you are pivoting your jaw and not "dropping" it

Smile!

Chest and shoulder/back posture - slide shoulder blades back or do relax exercises (shrugging)

Wing out arms to make space around body
