Thought from bike ride today - a hypothesis:
My mom usually shares deep and somewhat depressing/pessimistic thoughts with me. Therefore I tend to think of close connections as ones where I would do the same and complain/be depressed about things. Therefore I find meaning in suffering. I find it familiar when someone has a dark side to a usually bright facade and when I'm the only one who truly knows about her(his?) dark depressing background. This would not be healthy if true.
