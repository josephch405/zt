I want to learn new things. Learn new things from work, from reading, from doing, from meeting new people.

I tend to jump to coming up with fancy frameworks in theory.

Learning goals?

To improve at music. This is once again very vague. Specifically,
- Improve at vocals (range, style, expressiveness)
- Improve at composition (consistently making new tracks, polishing to a certian quality bar)

To improve at building products and know what to build.
- Spotting unmet needs in the market
- Brainstorming and executing solutions

To improve at understanding Japanese culture
- Be listening fluent in 90% of contexts
- Be conversational in 50% of contexts

To improve at connecting with other people
- In platonic and romantic contexts


I want to output more. It's very comfortable just ingesting information but I'm not gonna get to higher levels of understanding without action. Interacting and making mutable changes to the world.


Learnings from last week:
the 9-5 is a grind. Find some purpose in it because bonuses take forever to hit and traveling is expensive so you need money. no need to be constantly on edge either, you got through a day of meetings while still kinda high and probably did better. in fact no need to be on edge at all during any part of life.
look into CBD - as a side effect of being high and around people for a week, you were a lot more energetic. depression/anxiety possibly caused by cannobinoidal deficiency
you are worth talking to. but also remember that other people are worth talking to. you had a lot of fun, regardless of the stupid drama. people live for drama because this is all a story in the end.
travel more. you missed traveling and being in new locations.
Music is about storytelling - I have never fully tapped into this but the monthly courses are very clear cut about it. Use more variation vibrato and airiness as 2 of the 4 "knobs" (the others being pitch and volume)
