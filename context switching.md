There's always a cost associated with this. Hard to remember.

From a systems perspective, the cost stems from having to switch out an attention set/cache.

From a human perspective, it's very similar. The more I work in a particular flow, the more associated neurons and ideas activate. That encourages more of the same behavior until a switch is required (either internally or externally), and resources have to be realloced to account for a switch. It also takes hella time.

Maybe there's a better way to think about this - to fail out gracefully and to wind down properly after a chunk of work is completed in a particular area.

In relation to work, I can try to make some observations of context switching behavior over the last week. I've reduced my work stream down to two items - this is a good balance between being blocked constantly vs. being too spread out. Even with this reduction I still end up spending time on watching numbers go up. This is not a good habit. It feels like progress but I am not moving the needle at all. Better to take a step away from the process that runs in the background and literally do anything else - write, read, relax, socialize.
