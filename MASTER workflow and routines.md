I will develop a strong coming home routine. I have to plan around the variability of a coming home routine, since I often come home at different times. In general, I come home at around 5, 7, or 9 - first bus, second bus, or some other late event. I can't plan much for 9+ - but I can at least do the basics of cleaning up and getting ready. 7+ could be meaningful self development time. 5+ should lead to some kind of physical activity.

I really want to limit the amount of time I spend on league. Every time I play I'm never really that engaged. I do want to get better and stuff... but why? Purely for the social aspects? 

5
Exercise
	
7
Dinner
Music or code or game
Why would I ever choose hard things instead of music/code/"productive" items?

10
Shower
Clean house
Relax
Sleep asap

DEPREC

very much tied to routine, so this is also about routines

Current general routine is, in priority order:
1. Immediate concerns (meetings, deadlines by today etc)
2. [[Habits]]
4. General work items (up to 3 areas)
