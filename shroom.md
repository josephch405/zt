I don't have a lot of photos. I lose track of what I remember because of that. 

I lose track of things that I love. That I think I love. That I thought I loved. Maybe it's better that way.

I took off my glasses to see better. They never helped me with my vision anyway. Just kept things in place as everything else moved around, away from me.

The patterns on the sofa moved
Little villages sleepy at night
Unaware of the giant looking down above them
The hillowy pillowy creases and crevices

This is gonna be the notebook where I write down thoughts from the other side. No idea how many of these are gonna make it through.

Writing with a passion. I see the words kind of floating in and out as if they had a depth to them. 

The thing that psychedelics make people explore is their subconcsious. How the non-real manifolds unwrap the facade that is reality. When nothing is real, then it becomes true.

^
^
^ but yeah I wanted to write about feelings and stuff
^ cause you know
^ they're nice

^ you think you're just protecting other ppl from your own demons
^ your demons aint even shit other ppl have it worse

^ but also fleeting
^ because next when I wake I won't notice them

Continuing here with weed thoughts this is the best category I can put my thoughts in right now

I don't know what I'm doing. I just want to sit down and relax. The subliminal is a weird place to be because you realize shit that
