Motivation is obviously something that comes and goes, and to some extent success = how well you can capture and convert that momentum into something concrete

Some things to define: concrete progress, motivation, consciouseness/conscientiousness (I do not know the difference here hmm)

I want to figure out specific goals and outcomes. I've been thinking about abstract directions and fields but not enough about results. Therefore I don't feel that I am achieving anything important.

Setting OKRs for myself might be a good idea at this rate... but the tricky part is to be adaptable. I did not follow my old OKRs because I was too lazy to maintain and update them. Once they become irrelevant I lose motivation to stick to them. OKRs need to be aligned properly.
